name: principle-entry
description: Recognize, record, or revise a principle in process/principles/ — the transferable rules this project learns by making particular decisions. Use when a decision yields a rule that will govern chapters nobody has read yet, when the user says "that's a principle" or "worth keeping", when harvesting principles out of the notes, or when an existing entry needs promoting, demoting or superseding. Enforces detection, deduplication, the trigger standard, and the evidence threshold.

# Recording a principle

A principle here is almost always a **by-product**. Someone settles one line in one chapter and, in settling it, discovers a rule that governs sixty chapters nobody is looking at. Left where it was found, it is invisible — which is why `process/principles/` exists and why this procedure does.

**Read [`process/principles/README.md`](../../principles/README.md) for the standard.** This skill is the part the README does not cover: how to **find** one, how to know it is one, and how to write the field that makes it fire.

**Gloss every Chinese character, every time** — 為 (*wéi* — "to do / to handle"), never bare 為. Shalom does not read Chinese.

## 0. First, is it already recorded?

```bash
python3 tools/build_principles.py --applies drafting     # or glossary, notes, tooling, process
grep -i "<a keyword from your rule>" process/principles.yaml
```

**Do this before writing anything.** The most likely failure of a principles directory is not an empty one — it is three entries saying the same thing in different words, which is worse than none because a reader cannot tell which governs. If you find a near-match, the right move is usually to **add your case to its `evidence:`** and sharpen its wording, not to open a new file. Adding a second case is also what promotes it from `provisional` to `active`, so a merge is often more valuable than a new entry.

---

## 1. Detection — three passes, decreasing precision

Use all three when harvesting. Use the third habitually, because it is the one that finds what nobody labelled.

**Pass 1 — self-declared.** The rule announces itself.

```bash
grep -rniE "standing principle|general rule|general finding|the finding that outlives|principle this yields|rules? (came out of it|worth keeping)" notes/ CLAUDE.md DISCOVERIES.md ARCHITECTURE.md PLAN.md WORKLIST.md glossary/
```

High precision, poor recall. It only finds principles someone already knew were principles.

**Pass 2 — principle-shaped.** A universal or imperative claim that names **no chapter and no character**.

```bash
grep -noE "^\*\*[A-Z][^*]{25,110}\.\*\*" ARCHITECTURE.md process/method.md DISCOVERIES.md PLAN.md
```

A bolded lead sentence stating a rule is a principle that got scoped to one document. *"A diff gate is only as good as the generator's determinism"* is a principle; it was living in `ARCHITECTURE.md` where no one drafting a chapter would meet it.

**Pass 3 — repeated reasons.** The same justification given many times, abstracted never. **This is the richest source and no keyword search finds it.** Look at *why* things were rejected, and cluster.

The method: take a rejection reason you have just written, and grep for how many times the repository has already given it.

```bash
grep -rocE "is [^ ]+( \([^)]*\))?'s (own )?(word|English)" glossary/ notes/ chapters/ | awk -F: '{s+=$2} END{print s}'
```

**Two of this project's load-bearing rules were found exactly this way** — *"X is Y's word"* (45 instances) and *"this English renders no character"* (78) — each stated over a hundred times across the corpus and indexed zero times.

**Also hiding:** rules that exist only as **behaviour** (a workflow step in a skill, an ordering in `CLAUDE.md`'s tie-breaking list) and rules implied by **Shalom's corrections** (`CLAUDE.md` → *How Shalom works*). Those last are `applies: process` — about the collaboration, not the text.

---

## 2. The test that decides: write the trigger

**If you cannot write `trigger:`, you do not have a principle.** You have an observation, or a chapter note.

Complete this sentence: ***"When you are about to ___, this fires."***

| | |
|---|---|
| **completes naturally, names no chapter** | a principle |
| **requires naming a chapter or character to make sense** | a chapter note — it belongs in `notes/translation.md` |
| **completes, but fires on everything** | a rejection, not a principle |

That last row is the one that kills a principles directory. *"When you are translating"* fires always and therefore never. A trigger has to describe a **recognisable moment**, narrow enough that someone not looking for it still recognises themselves in it.

### Worked triggers

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | *"you are about to render a character by what it means in this line rather than by the word it carries elsewhere in the book"* |
| ✅ | *"you are about to put an English word in the verse that renders no character in the Chinese"* |
| ✅ | *"a rendering you like is already doing duty for a different character somewhere in the book"* |
| ❌ | *"you are drafting a chapter"* — fires on everything |
| ❌ | *"when accuracy matters"* — names no moment at all |
| ❌ | *"when working on chapter 14"* — that is a chapter note |

**Write the trigger in second person, present tense, describing the act — not the virtue.** The reader is mid-decision and needs to recognise what they are doing, not be told what to value.

---

## 3. Write the entry

Follow [`process/principles/README.md`](../../principles/README.md) → *Writing the entry*. In short: the rule, then the trigger, then **why it holds generally** — not why it held in the case that produced it. That general argument usually has to be **written rather than moved**: a rule that has only ever been stated as a coda to one decision has never actually been argued as a principle.

**Do not copy the chapter's argument.** Link to it. A hand-kept second copy of a decision is how the lock table in `CLAUDE.md` went stale twice in one week.

**Always include *"Where it does not fire."*** A rule with no boundary is a slogan, and it will be applied somewhere it does not belong. If you cannot name a boundary, the rule is probably too broad to be useful.

---

## 4. The evidence threshold, and how to earn the second case

**`provisional` until two independent cases; then `active`.** The build enforces it.

**Be honest about this rather than hunting for a second case to justify a rule you like.** One case is an observation — the repository has been burned by exactly that (`DISCOVERIES.md` §1's central claim was superseded), and `notes/translation.md` states the rule at ch 4: ***a distributional argument is a reason to look, not a reason to conclude.***

To look for a genuine second case:

```bash
python3 tools/concordance.py --english "<the rendering the rule is about>"
grep -rn "<the reason, in the words the notes would use>" notes/ glossary/ chapters/
```

A second case must be **independent** — a different chapter, a different term, arrived at separately. The same decision described twice is one case.

---

## 5. Anchors — the evidence links are checked

`evidence:` entries are `path/to/file.md#anchor`, and **the build verifies every one resolves to a real heading.** A principle whose link has rotted is worse than one with no link: it looks checked.

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'tools'); from build_principles import slug; print(slug('''<paste the heading text, without the #s>'''))"
```

**If the target has no stable heading, add one** — do not link to a line number, ever. `notes/translation.md` requires that its headings carry only the stable claim, with dates and *(was: …)* on the line beneath, precisely so these links survive. Follow that rule when you add a heading there.

---

## 6. Revising: promote, demote, supersede

- **Promote** `provisional` → `active` when a genuine second case arrives. Add it to `evidence:` and say in the entry what the new case added.
- **Demote** `active` → `provisional` if a case turns out not to be independent. This is not an embarrassment; it is the threshold working.
- **Supersede** — set `status: superseded`, add `supersedes:` on the replacement, and close the old entry with a section saying what replaced it and why. **Never delete.** A reader who finds the old rule quoted in a chapter note needs to follow it here and see that it fell.

**When a harvested "principle" does not survive scrutiny, record it as `provisional` with its one case — do not quietly promote it, and do not drop it.** Dropping it means the next person rediscovers it and has no idea it was weighed.

---

## 7. When not to write one

- **It explains one line.** Chapter note.
- **It is about one term.** Glossary entry — that is what the entry's prose is for.
- **It is a rule Shalom has set aside.** `process/shaloms-call.md`.
- **It is a fact about the witnesses.** `notes/manuscript.md` and `sources/variants.yaml`.
- **It restates something already written.** Merge into that entry instead.
- **You cannot name where it does not fire.** Not yet a principle.

---

## 8. Finish — every time, no exceptions

```bash
python3 tools/build_principles.py
```

Regenerates `process/principles/INDEX.md` and `process/principles.yaml`, validates the frontmatter, enforces the threshold, and verifies every anchor. **Never edit the generated files by hand.**

Then:

1. **Add the `evidence:` anchor's own note a pointer back**, if the decision that produced the rule does not already name it.
2. **If the principle contradicts something already written elsewhere in the repo, that is a finding** — `CLAUDE.md` → *"if you find them disagreeing, that is a finding: fix both and say which was wrong."* Do not silently pick a side.
3. **Report**: the rule, the trigger, the cases, and whether it shipped `provisional` or `active`.
