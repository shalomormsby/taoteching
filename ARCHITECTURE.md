# ARCHITECTURE — how this repository works

*A system-wide map: what holds authority, what is generated from it, what enforces the rules, and how a decision travels from a question about one character to a check that fails the build. For the translation **method**, see [`process/method.md`](process/method.md); for what the work still **owes**, see [`WORKLIST.md`](WORKLIST.md).*

---

## If you read only this

**This repository is a translation that behaves like a codebase.** Every settled decision about a Chinese word is written once, in prose, with its evidence — and then enforced mechanically across all 81 chapters, so it cannot quietly come undone.

Five things, and the first is the one to remember:

1. **If a command can rebuild it, never edit it by hand.** Three directories are edited by hand and hold the truth — `chapters/`, `glossary/`, and the YAML in `sources/`. Everything else, including the vendored commentaries, is generated and can be deleted and rebuilt.
2. **A glossary entry is both an essay and a machine-readable rule.** Its YAML frontmatter names the locked English and the forbidden alternatives; a build step turns that into `glossary/terms.yaml`, which the checker reads.
3. **The checker never fires on English alone.** A forbidden word is an error only when the Chinese character licensing it is present in *that same chapter's* source table. This is the design decision that makes the tool trustworthy enough to gate on.
4. **Two tools, opposite contracts.** `check_locks.py` optimizes precision and fails the build; `concordance.py` optimizes recall, judges nothing, and never fails.
5. **Every override is recorded and costs something** — one finding waived by a `lock-ok` comment carrying a reason, or a whole rule set aside in `process/shaloms-call.md` with an expiry. An unused waiver is itself an error, so the files self-clean.

  check_locks.py also reads chapters/ directly — it needs each chapter's own
  Chinese to decide whether a forbidden English is an error or a false friend.

  sources/commentaries/ and sources/shuowen/ are omitted above: they are build
  products too, written by the importers from gitignored wikitext caches.

  Everything below the AUTHORITY box is generated. Delete data/ and one command
  rebuilds it; delete chapters/ and the translation is gone.
```

---

## The one rule that explains most of the design

> **If a command can rebuild it, never edit it by hand.**

**Every file here is either edited or generated, and none is both.** Before changing any file, ask whether some command produces it. If one does, you are in the wrong file: your change will be silently overwritten by the next build, and whatever you meant to fix lives upstream in the file the tool read.

**Three directories are edited by hand, and they are the truth:**

- `chapters/001-081.md` — the manuscript, edited by Shalom (or another person)
- `glossary/*.md` — the rulings, essay and frontmatter together
- `sources/*.yaml` — the witness apparatus and the Guodian inventory, kept by hand as **facts**, never transcriptions

**Everything else is a build product** — `data/taoteching.sqlite`, every CSV, `explorer.html`, the constellation JSON, `glossary/INDEX.md`, `glossary/terms.yaml`, and **`sources/commentaries/` and `sources/shuowen/`, which are written by importers**. The Markdown build products carry a header saying so; the CSVs cannot, since a comment line would break parsing, so [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) covers them instead.

**`sources/` is therefore split, and the split matters:** the YAML files are hand-kept judgments about what the witnesses read, and the vendored directories are machine-written transcriptions of public-domain texts. Editing a commentary file by hand would break the guarantee that `import_commentary.py` reproduces it byte for byte.

**Why the rule earns its place.** It is what lets the repository be aggressive about tooling without the tooling becoming the work. Delete `data/` entirely and one command rebuilds it. Delete `chapters/` and the translation is gone. It also tells you where a fix belongs: 義 (*yì* — duty) once shipped in the character atlas glossed *"and"*, and the repair was not in the CSV that showed it but two levels upstream — a misplaced bracket in ch 18's source table, and a tie-break in `build_db.py`.

**Two places the rule bends, both deliberate:**

- **`source/chinese.md`** is *derived* from the chapters' own source tables but is **committed and hand-maintained**, because it is the convenient whole-text file several tools read. Change a source table and it must be rebuilt by hand. The `source-drift` rule exists to catch the two falling out of step.
- **`sources/commentaries/`** is generated by `import_commentary.py`, but from wikitext caches that are **gitignored**. So it is a build product whose inputs are not in the repository: re-runnable by anyone with network access, not by a fresh offline clone. That is the price of vendoring provenance rather than pasting text.

---

## The three authorities

| | Owns | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| **`chapters/001–081.md`** | **The manuscript.** The `## Translation` block *is* the translation — there is no upstream and nothing regenerates over it. Each file also carries the chapter's Chinese source table, its per-chapter Notes, and frontmatter (`status`, `retrofit`). | One file per chapter |
| **`glossary/*.md`** | **The rulings.** One entry per term: what the character is, what the conventional English gets wrong, what the classical commentators say, what is set aside and why. The frontmatter carries `render` and `forbidden`. | 35 entries, 13 secondary characters |
| **`sources/`** | **The evidence**, and the one mixed directory. Hand-kept: `variants.yaml` (the witness apparatus, as facts), `guodian-inventory.yaml`, `component-glosses.yaml`, `heshanggong-titles.yaml`. Machine-written: `commentaries/` (three classical commentaries in full) and `shuowen/` (說文解字 — *Shuōwén Jiězì*, the c. 100 CE etymological dictionary). | See *Provenance* below |

Everything else supports these. `notes/` records decisions thinly in three layers — manuscript forks, our own rendering calls, reader-facing threads — and `WORKLIST.md` tracks what is still owed.

---

## How a decision becomes an enforced rule

This is the operational heart of the system. A question about one character becomes a check that fails the build in six steps.

```
1. EVIDENCE      concordance.py <char>          every occurrence, line, gloss, verse
                 concordance.py --english "x"   the reverse: is the rendering backed by the character?
                 concordance.py --commentary N  王弼 (Wáng Bì) and 河上公 (Héshàng Gōng)
                 concordance.py --witnesses N   where the older manuscripts disagree
                        │
2. RULING        glossary/<pinyin>-<char>.md    the essay: graph, commentators, rejected
                        │                        candidates, the flexions, what stays open
                        │
3. FRONTMATTER   render: "strong"                the machine-readable shadow of the essay
                 forbidden: ["mighty", …]
                        │
4. GENERATE      build_index.py                  → glossary/terms.yaml  (the locks, as data)
                        │                        → glossary/INDEX.md    (the human lookup)
                        │
5. ENFORCE       check_locks.py                  reads terms.yaml; a new lock is a live check
                        │                        the moment it is regenerated — no code change
                        │
6. SWEEP         fix the chapters the new lock   mechanical swaps applied immediately;
                 now contradicts                 rewrites proposed first, then applied
```

**Step 5 is the point.** Adding a lock requires no change to the checker. Write the entry, run `build_index.py`, and the rule is live across all 81 chapters.

**Step 6 is the discipline.** The policy is *fix on discovery, not in a deferred batch* — a settled lock that has not been swept is a lock that is quietly false.

---

## What is generated, and from what

| Product | Built by | From | Committed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `glossary/INDEX.md` · `glossary/terms.yaml` | `build_index.py` | every entry's frontmatter, plus chapter lists recomputed from `source/chinese.md` | yes — CI fails if stale |
| `data/taoteching.sqlite` | `build_db.py` | `chapters/`, `glossary/`, `sources/` | yes |
| `data/*.csv` | `export.py` | the sqlite | yes — a binary blob cannot be diffed or reviewed; the CSVs can |
| `data/explorer.html` | `build_explorer.py` | the sqlite | yes — self-contained, no network |
| `data/constellation-*.json` | `build_graph.py` | the sqlite | yes |
| `sources/commentaries/*/` | `import_commentary.py` | cached wikitext (gitignored) | yes — re-runnable to byte-identical output |
| `sources/shuowen/entries.md` | `import_shuowen.py` | cached wikitext | yes |
| `source/chinese.md` | *by hand, from the chapters' source tables* | — | yes |

**The importers verify themselves.** `import_commentary.py` checks every lemma it vendors against our own base text and marks the divergent ones with `*`. That check is what makes the vendored files evidence rather than decoration — and when it was missing for 韓非 (*Hán Fēi*), the files asserted an agreement nobody had tested.

---

## Two tools, opposite contracts

Merging them would produce something too noisy to gate on and too quiet to search with.

**`check_locks.py` — the gate. Optimizes precision.** Exits non-zero, runs in CI and the pre-commit hook, and must never cry wolf. Twelve rules, each citing a written decision. A rule with no citation would be a tool author's opinion wearing a build's authority.

**`concordance.py` — the report. Optimizes recall.** Judges nothing, never fails, exists to put evidence in front of a person before a decision is made.

```bash
python3 tools/concordance.py 明                    # a character: every chapter, line, gloss, verse
python3 tools/concordance.py --english "clarity"   # the reverse direction — see below
python3 tools/concordance.py --pairs 玄 妙          # a term and its partner
python3 tools/concordance.py --formulas            # Chinese segments repeated across chapters
python3 tools/concordance.py --witnesses 25        # where the older manuscripts disagree
python3 tools/concordance.py --commentary 63       # the classical commentators on a chapter
```

**`--english` is the mode that catches what no rule can.** A lock is a two-way claim: every 強 (*qiáng* — strong) renders as *strong*, **and** every *strong* renders 強. The checker can only ever test the first direction, because its evidence gate keys off the character being present. The second direction found 固 (*gù* — firm) and 壯 (*zhuàng* — in its prime) both wearing 強's English inside chapters that contain 強 — invisible to every rule, by construction. **Run `--english` on every lock.**

---

## The gates

Three, in widening scope.

| | Scope | Severity | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`.githooks/pre-commit`** | only the chapters being committed, skipping `status: untranslated` | errors only | the commit |
| **`.github/workflows/checks.yml`** | the whole book, every push and PR | errors fail; warnings and info are logged in a separate step where they cannot be mistaken for failures | the merge |
| **running the tools by hand** | whatever you ask for | all | nothing |

Install the hook with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. It is deliberately narrow: a half-drafted chapter must never have to argue with a tool.

CI additionally runs the checker's own tests, verifies the verse's hard line breaks, and fails if `glossary/INDEX.md` or `terms.yaml` is stale — proving the generated files match the entries they came from.

**No dependency install step, deliberately.** Every tool is stdlib Python only, so a fresh clone can run the whole gate with nothing else present.

---

## The twelve rules

| Rule | Protects | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `forbidden-rendering` | every locked term's `forbidden:` list | **error** when the character is in that chapter; `info` otherwise |
| `sage-pronoun` | 聖人 (*shèng rén* — the sage) is never "he" | **error**, never gated — absolute |
| `devotional-capitalization` | lowercase everything but the Tao; capitals turn a word into a doctrine | **error** when the character is present; `info` otherwise |
| `mechanistic-register` | "source code", "operating system", "generate" — our own besetting temptation | **error** |
| `status-coherence` | `status: drafted` must mean there is a translation | **error** |
| `source-drift` | a chapter's Chinese must match `source/chinese.md` | **error** |
| `repeated-formula` | verbatim Chinese in two chapters should read alike in English | **warn** — a reading for a person, not a verdict |
| `em-dash` | dashes in the verse strand subjects | `info` |
| `unlogged-variant` | a meaning-bearing manuscript fork must have a logged decision | **error** (unlogged) · **warn** (logged to a file with no such entry) |
| `unmarked-lemma` | a vendored lemma differing from our base text must carry its `*` | **error** (unmarked) · **warn** (marked but agreeing) |
| `stale-shaloms-call` | an override that outlived its expiry | **error** |
| `shaloms-call-unparsed` | a call the tool cannot see is a rule silently not suspended | **error** |
| *(plus)* `unused-waiver` | a `lock-ok` that matches nothing | **error** |

### The evidence gate

**No rule fires on English alone.** *Virtue* is an error only when 德 (*dé* — integrity) is in that chapter's own Chinese; otherwise it drops to `info` in a separate false-friends list. This is possible because every chapter file carries its own source table, and it is the difference between twenty flags and nine findings.

It also has a known blind spot, stated plainly here so nobody rediscovers it as a surprise: **the gate cannot express *right for that character, wrong for this one, in the same chapter*.** So *integrity* cannot be forbidden for 信 (*xìn* — trust), because chapters 21, 23, 38 and 49 hold both 信 and 德. Those distinctions live in the entry's prose and in the reader.

Two consequences for writing a `forbidden:` list: **a capital in the string means the capital is the violation** (`"the Way"` leaves *the way of nature* legal), and **a forbidden phrase can be defeated by an inserted word** (`"the Way"` misses *the great Way*) — so forbid the bare word where register matters more than phrasing.

---

## Escape hatches, and why each costs something

Unsuppressable rules get disabled wholesale; free suppression rots. So both hatches are recorded and both expire.

| | Scope | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **`lock-ok` comment** in a chapter's `## Notes` | one finding | must carry a reason, and an **unused waiver is itself an error** — so the files self-clean |
| **`process/shaloms-call.md`** | a whole rule | requires a scope, an expiry and a reason; the checker prints a footer naming active calls, and an expired call fails the build |
| **`git commit --no-verify`** | one commit | leaves no record — which is the point: a second `--no-verify` on the same rule is the signal that a call is owed |

**Never delete a rule to silence it.**

---

## Trust tiers in the character atlas

`data/characters.csv` carries a gloss for every character in the book, and the `gloss_source` column says how much to trust it.

| tier | source | trust |
|---|---|---|
| `locked` | a settled rendering in `terms.yaml` | high — the edition's own decision |
| `covers` | a secondary character absorbed by an entry | high |
| `apparatus` | the `[pinyin]` notes in the source tables' Literal column, where a **strict majority** of occurrences agreed | working approximation |
| `apparatus-split` | the apparatus glossed it and no English won a majority — **the cell is deliberately blank** | none |
| `none` | nothing in the repository glosses it yet | — |

**A plurality is not a definition.** A character glossed six different ways in six places has a context, not a meaning — so the build refuses to pick one, and records the agreement ratio instead. The apparatus glosses also speak **pre-lock English** ("virtue", "the ten thousand things"), which is exactly what this edition rejects; they are a starting point and never override a lock.

---

## Provenance — the licensing architecture

The repository is **CC0, with no exceptions**, and a companion volume must be able to draw on it commercially. That constrains what may be vendored, and the constraint is architectural rather than incidental.

| Material | Call | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 王弼 · 河上公 · 韓非 commentaries | **vendor** | pre-1929 printings exist; public domain by age |
| The Laozi base text | **vendor** | ancient; provenanced to four named pre-1929 printings |
| 說文解字 (*Shuōwén Jiězì*) | **vendor** | c. 100 CE |
| **Mawangdui** (excavated 1973) · **Guodian** (1993) | **never vendor** | every transcription is modern, and reconstructing damaged graphs is living scholarship |
| Modern critical apparatus, annotations, translations | **never vendor** | in copyright |

**For the excavated witnesses, record the fact rather than the text.** *"Mawangdui A and B read 自今及古 (*zì jīn jí gǔ* — from now back to antiquity) where Wang Bi reads 自古及今 (*zì gǔ jí jīn* — from antiquity until now)"* is a fact about a text, and facts are not copyrightable. That is what `sources/variants.yaml` is: an apparatus of facts, never transcriptions. `sources/guodian-inventory.yaml` answers only *does the oldest witness carry this chapter at all* — it carries 31 of 81.

Read [`sources/PROVENANCE.md`](sources/PROVENANCE.md) before adding anything to `sources/`.

**A separate rule governs consultation, not vendoring:** sources are consulted for **meaning, never for phrasing**, and only pre-1931 public-domain translations may be consulted at all. There are no English translations in this repository.

## Invariants

The things that must stay true. Most are enforced; the ones that are not are marked.

1. **`chapters/*.md` is the manuscript.** Nothing regenerates over it.
2. **Generated files are never hand-edited** — `INDEX.md`, `terms.yaml`, everything in `data/`, everything in `sources/commentaries/`.
3. **A locked term's frontmatter is the single source of truth for its rule.** *(enforced: CI fails if the generated files are stale)*
4. **Verse line breaks are two trailing spaces.** A single newline renders as a space and collapses a stanza into a paragraph. Never trim trailing whitespace in `.md` here; `.editorconfig` and the VS Code settings guard it. *(enforced)*
5. **Every meaning-bearing manuscript fork has a logged decision.** *(enforced)*
6. **Every vendored lemma that differs from our base text carries its `*`.** *(enforced)*
7. **Stdlib only.** A fresh clone runs the whole gate with no install step. *(not enforced — hold the line by hand)*
8. **Never write a Chinese character without an English rendering beside it** — in any file, any commit message, any conversation. *(not enforced; the most-broken rule in the repository, which is why it is a banner at the top of `CLAUDE.md`)*
9. **Sources are consulted for meaning, never for phrasing.** *(not enforceable)*
