concordance.py — a character in, the evidence out.

The counterpart to check_locks.py, and the opposite kind of tool. The checker
optimizes precision: it must not cry wolf, and it exits non-zero. This optimizes
recall: it shows everything remotely relevant, judges nothing, and never fails.
Do not merge them — a tool that gates and searches at once ends up too noisy to
gate and too quiet to search.
