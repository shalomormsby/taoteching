"""build_graph.py — the corpus as a knowledge graph, for the OpenCosmos constellation.

    python3 tools/build_graph.py                 # both graphs
    python3 tools/build_graph.py --graph text    # chapters only, existing schema
    python3 tools/build_graph.py --graph chars   # the character graph

Writes `data/constellation-*.json` in the node/link shape
`scripts/knowledge/generate-constellation-graph.ts` already emits, so the
OpenCosmos generator can merge these payloads instead of parsing this repo.

**Why the payload and not the renderer.** This repository is stdlib-only Python
and its CI has no dependency-install step, deliberately — a fresh clone runs the
checks with nothing else present. `@opencosmos/constellation` is a React/WebGL
package. Putting it here would trade that property away for a picture. So the
boundary is drawn at the data: **this repo emits, OpenCosmos renders.** Neither
side acquires the other's dependency tree.

**Why this is licence-safe, which is not an accident.** OpenCosmos decision 0009
rejected `@cosmograph/cosmograph` because it is CC BY-NC-4.0, and non-commercial
"constrains what OpenCosmos can ever become." That is the same argument
`sources/PROVENANCE.md` makes about texts, applied to code — and it is why these
two repositories can meet at all. This repo is CC0 with no exceptions and the
companion volume is intended to be sold; a CC BY-NC dependency anywhere in the
chain would poison both. `@cosmos.gl/graph` is MIT. The compatibility was won by
a decision someone already made carefully, on the other side.

Two graphs, because they answer different questions.

**text** — the shape OpenCosmos already speaks: one `work` node, 81 `section`
nodes, edges of type `contains`. This is the translation taking its place in the
corpus beside the other traditions.

**chars** — the shape this corpus alone can offer: every character, every part it
is built from, and every chapter, wired together. A force-directed layout over
shared components does something a list cannot — it puts the water characters
near each other without being told to, because they share 水. The semantic
families lay themselves out.
