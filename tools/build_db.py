"""build_db.py — assemble the manuscript into a queryable corpus.

**This is a generated artifact and is never authoritative.** `chapters/*.md` is
the manuscript, exactly as it is for `glossary/INDEX.md` and `glossary/terms.yaml`.
Anything that disagrees with a chapter file is this tool's bug.

Two design commitments are load-bearing.

**The addressable unit is a coordinate, not a text.** Every character in the book
has an address `(chapter, line_seq, char_pos)`. Witnesses attach to those
addresses — as full text where their edition is admissible, and as typed variant
facts where it is not. `sources/PROVENANCE.md` excludes transcriptions of the
excavated manuscripts outright and says a `shaloms-call` cannot reach it, so this
is not a preference the schema can be talked out of later.

**No row carries a Chinese character without pinyin and English beside it.**
`CLAUDE.md` standing rule 0, made mechanical. A `characters.csv` that opens as a
column of glyphs is that rule broken 798 times in one file, and the rule records
its own repeated failure as prose. Here it is a check that fails the build.

Stdlib only — a fresh clone runs it with nothing installed.

    # ---- commentary --------------------------------------------------------
    # A lemma is a slice of the base text, so our own English for the lines it
    # covers is already written and free to attach. Matching it is not a plain
    # equality test, for three reasons the data shows plainly:
    #
    #   1. a lemma often spans several of our lines, run together without
    #      punctuation — Wang Bi's first is 道可道非常道名可名非常名, which is two;
    #   2. the Siku and Song woodblocks use different glyph forms — 衆 for 眾,
    #      㣲 for 微, 𤣥 for 玄 (the last outside the BMP entirely);
    #   3. the Siku compilers' own 〔…〕 collation notes ride along inside it.
    #
    # So the chapter is concatenated into one folded string with an index back to
    # line numbers, and the folded lemma is located inside it. import_commentary's
    # `fold` already handles (2) and (3), and its CJK range is wider than this
    # module's on purpose: a narrower one silently deletes 𤣥.
