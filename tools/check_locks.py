check_locks.py — the settled decisions of this translation, as tests.

The glossary carries the reasoning. CLAUDE.md carries the rules. This carries
neither: it only checks that the manuscript still obeys what has already been
decided somewhere else. Every rule below cites the written decision it enforces,
and a rule with no citation does not belong here.

    python3 tools/check_locks.py                  # everything
    python3 tools/check_locks.py --chapter 53
    python3 tools/check_locks.py --rule devotional-capitalization -v
    python3 tools/check_locks.py --staged         # what the pre-commit hook runs
    python3 tools/check_locks.py --json

Exits non-zero when an error-severity rule fires. Warnings and info never fail.

Two things this tool will never do: rewrite the verse, or judge it. It reports
where the manuscript departs from a decision already made, and stops there.
