**What this is for.** This project reads by decomposing characters to their parts
— it is the method, not a flourish: `glossary/qiang-強.md` turns on 強 being
蚚也，从虫弘聲 ("the grain weevil; from 虫 insect, with 弘 as phonetic"), and
`glossary/ruo-弱.md` on 弱 being two bows. Until now every one of those readings
was looked up by hand, one character at a time, and none of it was indexed.

**Why 說文解字 and not a modern character database.** Two reasons, and the second
matters more.

*Rights.* 說文解字 (*Shuōwén Jiězì*, Xu Shen 許慎, ~100 CE) is public domain by age
and the Wikisource transcription names its edition — 四部叢刊初編, the same series
the Heshang Gong text came from. It clears `sources/PROVENANCE.md`'s four
admission rules by an already-trodden route. A modern character database would
raise a licensing question this repository does not need to answer.

*Fitness.* A 康熙 (Kangxi) radical is an **index** — the bucket a character is
filed under so you can find it — and it flattens the one distinction that carries
meaning. 說文 states its analysis in its own text and keeps that distinction
explicit: 从X marks a **semantic** component, X聲 marks a **phonetic** one, present
for sound alone. Told that 強 is "from 虫 (insect)", a reader learns something
true; told its radical is 弓 (bow), they learn how a Qing editor filed it. Both
are worth having and they are not the same fact, so they are stored in different
columns.

**What is vendored.** Only the entries for characters that occur in the Laozi —
the corpus lexicon, not the whole dictionary. That is a selection of public-domain
text, marked as one. The raw volumes are cached under `sources/.cache/`
(gitignored) so the vendoring is reproducible, exactly as import_commentary.py
does it.

**What is NOT here: English.** 說文's definitions are classical Chinese and are
vendored untranslated. Rendering ~800 of them by machine would manufacture
scholarship nobody did, which `sources/PROVENANCE.md` forbids in spirit and
`process/method.md` §3 forbids in terms. The *components* are glossed, because
that is where the explorable value is: seeing 天 (tiān — sky) as 一 (one) over
大 (big) needs no translation of 顛也. Definitions are glossed by hand as
characters earn entries.

# 說文解字 — the characters of the Laozi

*The earliest systematic analysis of Chinese characters, c. 100 CE. Vendored as a
**selection**: only the characters that occur in this text, which is the corpus
lexicon rather than the dictionary. The Chinese is Xu Shen's and is public domain
by age; the parse into semantic and phonetic components is mechanical, from his
own 从X / X聲 formulas, and is recorded here rather than inferred at read time.*

**The definitions are untranslated, deliberately.** Machine-rendering ~800
classical Chinese definitions would manufacture scholarship nobody did. Component
characters are glossed elsewhere (the corpus lexicon), which is where the
explorable value sits: 天 as 一 over 大 is legible without translating 顛也.

**Columns.** `char` (as our recension writes it) · `headword` (the graph 說文 files
it under — 明 is entered as 朙) · `matched_by` · `radical` (the 說文 section, which
is not always the Kangxi one) · `kind` · `semantic` (从X — components carrying
meaning) · `phonetic` (X聲 — components present for sound alone) · `fanqie` (the
Middle Chinese spelling, where the transcription carries one) · `definition`
(Xu Shen, verbatim).
