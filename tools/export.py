**Why CSV and not just the database.** The `.sqlite` is a binary blob: git cannot
diff it, a reviewer cannot read it, and a spreadsheet is what a person actually
opens. So the database is gitignored and these exports are committed. The
property that buys is worth the duplication — **every future change to the
manuscript shows up as a diff in the data**, the same way `glossary/INDEX.md`
already makes a lock change visible.

**Standing rule 0 is enforced here, not merely intended.** `--check` fails if any
row carries a Han character without pinyin and English beside it. `CLAUDE.md`
records that rule being broken repeatedly despite being written down; a column of
bare glyphs in a file headed "characters" is that failure at scale. Columns are
ordered identity-first for the same reason: character, pinyin, gloss, and only
then the counts.

README = """# `data/` — the corpus as data

**Generated. Do not edit by hand.** Rebuild with:

python3 tools/export.py        # writes the .csv files in this directory
```

The manuscript is `chapters/001–081.md`. Everything here is derived from it, the
way `glossary/INDEX.md` and `glossary/terms.yaml` are derived from the glossary
entries. Anything here that disagrees with a chapter file is a bug in the tools.

## Reading these files without reading Chinese

Every row that carries a Chinese character carries its pinyin and an English
rendering beside it. That is `CLAUDE.md` standing rule 0, and `tools/export.py
--check` fails the build if any row breaks it.

**The `gloss_source` column tells you how much to trust a gloss.**

| value | where it came from | trust |
|---|---|---|
| `locked` | a settled rendering in `glossary/terms.yaml` | high — this is the edition's own decision |
| `covers` | a secondary character absorbed by a glossary entry | high |
| `apparatus` | the `[pinyin]` notes in the Literal column of the source tables | **working approximation** |
| `none` | nothing in this repo glosses this character yet | — |

`apparatus` glosses are harvested from the source tables' literal column, which
`CLAUDE.md` warns speaks pre-lock English. They are a starting point, never a
ruling, and they never override a lock. The `gloss_agreement` column shows how
many of a character's glossed occurrences agreed on the winning English: `17/31`
means the character was glossed 31 times and the chosen English won 17 of them.
**A low ratio means the character is contextual, not that the gloss is wrong** —
之 (*zhī*) is a particle and will never have one English.

`none` is not hidden. Roughly 389 of the 798 distinct characters have no per-
character English in this repository yet. That gap is the glossary's worklist.

## The files

| file | one row per | good for |
|---|---|---|
| `characters.csv` | distinct character | frequency, coverage, what is glossed |
| `compounds.csv` | multi-character locked term | 萬物, 無為, 天地, 自然, 知足 |
| `lines.csv` | source line | Chinese, pinyin, literal gloss and our English side by side |
| `translation.csv` | verse line | the whole book in English, stanzas intact |
| `chapters.csv` | chapter | ratios, Guodian attestation, Heshang Gong's titles |
| `variants.csv` | witness reading at a fork | where the manuscripts disagree |
| `witnesses.csv` | witness | who they are, when, and on what rights basis |
| `locked-renderings.csv` | locked character occurrence | whether the lock is honored at that line |
| `commentary.csv` | commentary lemma | 王弼, 河上公, 韓非, with our English for the lemma |

## Two cautions that matter

**`alignment_method` is not decoration.** Our English verse lines and the Chinese
source lines are 1:1 in only 30 of 81 chapters (835 verse lines against 798
source lines). Where the counts match, `alignment_method` is `exact-count` and
the pairing is certain. Where they do not, it is `proportional` — a positional
guess at confidence 0.3, recorded so it can be improved, and **not evidence of
anything**. `rendering_present = NOT FOUND` on a `proportional` row usually means
the alignment is wrong, not the translation.

**The excavated manuscripts are facts here, never text.** 郭店 (*Guōdiàn*),
馬王堆 (*Mǎwángduī*) and 北大 (*Běidà*) appear only in `variants.csv`, as recorded
disagreements with citations. `sources/PROVENANCE.md` explains why: reconstructing
damaged graphs is living scholarship, and this repository is CC0 with no
exceptions. `witnesses.csv` marks them `FACTS ONLY` in the rights column.
